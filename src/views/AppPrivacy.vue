      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: July 29, 2024</p>
      <p>Welcome to MEA - https://mea.vn</p>
      <p>
        At MEA, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal data you share
        with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we use Google Drive API to allow you to manage
        your files and images on our website. Please read this policy carefully to understand how
        your information is handled.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
      <p>
        Our website does not collect any personal data from you. We do not store or access your
        Google Drive files and images on our servers. All interactions with your Google Drive
        account are conducted directly through Google’s services.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Use of Google Drive API</h3>
      <p>
        We use Google Drive API solely to enable you to manage your own files and images. This
        includes actions such as uploading, viewing, editing, and deleting files within your Google
        Drive account. The API integration is used strictly for these purposes, and we do not
        access, store, or share any data from your Google Drive with any third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>3. User Control and Data Access</h3>
      <p>
        You have complete control over your files and images stored in your Google Drive. Our
        website only provides a platform for you to interact with your data, and at no point do we
        access or store your data. You can revoke access to the Google Drive API at any time through
        your Google account settings.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        Since our website does not collect or store any of your data, we rely on Google’s security
        measures to protect your files and images. Google implements industry-leading security
        practices to safeguard your information.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or
        for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this
        page, and the effective date will be updated accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        We do not use any third-party services that access your data. The only integration on our
        website is with Google Drive via Google Drive API, which is used solely for the purposes
        described above. Any data managed through Google Drive remains within Google's ecosystem,
        and we do not share or transmit this data to other services.
      </p>

      <h3>7. User Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        As a user, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Google account
        and ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to your account. We encourage you
        to use strong passwords and take other security measures to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Cookies and Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        Our website does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any other tracking technologies. We do
        not monitor your activities on our website, and there are no third-party advertisements or
        analytics services that collect data about you.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Legal Compliance</h3>
      <p>
        We comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding data protection and user
        privacy. Since we do not collect or store personal data, our obligations are limited to
        ensuring the secure interaction between your Google Drive account and our website.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        As we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no data retention policy
        applicable to user data. All data management is performed directly within Google Drive, and
        any data retention or deletion policies would be governed by Google's terms.
      </p>
